Day 8: Basic String Manipulation 🔤
📌 Topic  
String Manipulation — working with characters and words to solve classic problems like palindromes, anagrams, and word reversal.

String problems test logic, edge cases, and efficient traversal, and they are very common in coding interviews.

🛠️ Core Concepts  
- Character frequency counting  
- String traversal techniques  
- Comparing strings efficiently  
- Reversing words without extra space  
- Handling spaces and edge cases  

🧪 Practice Problems  

1️⃣ Anagram  

Goal:  
Check whether two given strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters with the same frequencies).

Key Idea:  
- Count character frequencies (using array or hashmap)  
- Compare counts of both strings  
- If all counts match → strings are anagrams

2️⃣ Reverse Words in a Given String  

Goal:  
Reverse the order of words in a string while keeping characters within each word intact.

Key Idea:  
- Split the string using a delimiter  
- Reverse the list of words  
- Join them back into a single string
