Day 1: Time & Space Complexity (The Interview Language)

    Topic: Understanding Big O notation. You cannot pass a interview without explaining why your code is fast.

        Missing Number in Array (Solve in O(n) time)  ->  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/missing-number-in-array1416/1

Daily Info: In Python, avoid operations like item in list inside a loop, as that turns your code into O(N2). For the "Missing Number," use the Sum Formula 2n(n+1)​ to solve it in O(1) space, rather than creating a new list.
